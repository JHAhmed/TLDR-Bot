# TLDR-Bot
A discord bot built on Python that summarizes conversations in your server using OpenAI's GPT 3.5 API.
Replace the `"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"` on line 15 of `bot.py` with your own discord bot token.
Replace the `"YOUR_API_KEY"` on line 2 of `responses.py` with your own OpenAI API key.
Use "!tldr {number}" in any channel/thread of your discord server to summarize that many messages. The upper limit is set to 100 for now, but try changing it and see if you can get it to work!
