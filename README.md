# TLDR-Bot
A discord bot built on Python that summarizes conversations in your server using ~~OpenAI's GPT 3.5 API~~ Google's Gemini Pro API.
Bring your own BOT_TOKEN and API_KEY in an `.env` (or heck, plug them directly into the code!)
This bot supports slash commands, use `/summarize {number} {style}` to TL;DR a number of messages in different styles!

Roadmap:
- Add support OpenAI's GPT models
- Add option to exlude users
- Support for more messages
- More styles?
